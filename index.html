     <p>Big data and analytics are everywhere in the media nowadays. Despite the hype, there's no denying the utility of analytics and some of the accomplishments that have been made because of it. I believe data can be beautiful: in particular good analysis and visualization of data is beautiful. I also think that the collaboration and sharing that the internet has produced is inspiring. I wouldn't know half of what I do if it weren't for blogs, MOOCs, online course notes and other resources. In that vein, this is a site to share things I'm learning.</p>
